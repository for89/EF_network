\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{research-questions}

\textbf{Research Question 1 (Primary): EF Network Structure Within
Cohorts}\\
Within each cohort and wave, what is the age-adjusted EF
network---defined by partial correlations among working memory,
inhibition, and cognitive flexibility---and what do global strength and
expected influence indicate about overall connectivity and node
centrality?

\textbf{Research Question 2 (Primary): Developmental Change Within
Cohorts}\\
Within each cohort, do the EF conditional associations (partial
correlations) change across adjacent waves (AU: T1→T2→T3; SA: T1→T2),
and if so, which specific edges strengthen or weaken over time?

\textbf{Research Question 3 (Secondary): Cross-Cohort Comparisons}\\
At matched waves (T1 and T2), do AU and SA differ in EF conditional
associations, and do the cohorts show divergent developmental
trajectories from T1 to T2 (difference-in-differences)?

\textbf{Research Question 4 (Exploratory): Socioeconomic Moderation of
Network Structure}\\
Within each cohort, does EF network structure differ between children
from high versus low baseline (T1) household income and home learning
environments? Specifically, are edges systematically stronger or weaker
in high-SES groups across waves?

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

\subsubsection{Network Estimation}\label{network-estimation}

We estimated EF network structure using Bayesian Gaussian Graphical
Models (BGGM) (\citeproc{ref-williams2020bayesian}{Williams \& Mulder,
2020a}, \citeproc{ref-williams2020bggm}{2020b}) implemented in the BGGM
R package (\citeproc{ref-BGGM}{Williams et al., 2025}). For each
cohort×wave combination, we fit a separate network model to capture the
conditional relationships between the three EF components (inhibition,
cognitive flexibility, and working memory) after controlling for age. We
used default priors and ran MCMC sampling for 5,050 iterations (5,000
posterior samples after 50 burn-in iterations).

\subsubsection{Edge Weights}\label{edge-weights}

Edges represent the conditional associations between pairs of EF
components. Technically, edge weights are partial correlations: the
correlation between two components after controlling for all other
components in the network and age. A positive edge indicates that two EF
components tend to covary (e.g., children with higher working memory
also tend to have higher inhibition, beyond what age would predict),
while a negative edge would indicate an inverse relationship. Edge
weights range from −1 to +1, with values closer to 0 indicating weaker
associations.

For each edge, we report the posterior median (a point estimate of the
edge strength) and the 95\% credible interval (CrI), which contains the
true edge weight with 95\% probability given the data and model. Unlike
frequentist confidence intervals, credible intervals can be directly
interpreted as probability statements about the parameter.

\subsubsection{Meaningfulness Threshold}\label{meaningfulness-threshold}

To distinguish meaningful edges from those that are small or negligible,
we adopted a Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) approach
(\citeproc{ref-kruschke2018rejecting}{Kruschke, 2018}). We defined the
ROPE as \textbar r\textbar{} ≤ 0.10, such that edge weights falling
within ±0.10 were considered practically equivalent to zero. For each
edge, we computed P(\textbar r\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.10): the
posterior probability that the edge weight exceeds the ROPE threshold in
absolute value. Values close to 1 (e.g., P \textgreater{} 0.90) indicate
strong evidence that the edge is meaningfully different from zero, while
values close to 0.5 indicate substantial uncertainty.

This approach differs from traditional null hypothesis significance
testing in two ways. First, it focuses on practical significance (is the
effect large enough to matter?) rather than statistical significance (is
the effect different from exactly zero?). Second, it quantifies evidence
on a continuous scale rather than using a binary reject/fail-to-reject
decision rule.

\subsubsection{Global Strength}\label{global-strength}

Global strength summarizes overall network connectivity by summing the
absolute values of all unique edge weights. Higher global strength
indicates a more densely connected network where EF components are more
strongly coupled. We computed global strength for each posterior sample,
yielding a posterior distribution that captures uncertainty in this
summary metric.

Formally, for a network with \emph{p} nodes, global strength is:

\[
GS = \sum_{i<j} |r_{ij}|
\]

where \emph{r\textsubscript{ij}} is the partial correlation between
nodes \emph{i} and \emph{j}. For our three-node networks, global
strength is simply \textbar r\textsubscript{inhib-cogflex}\textbar{} +
\textbar r\textsubscript{inhib-WM}\textbar{} +
\textbar r\textsubscript{cogflex-WM}\textbar.

\subsubsection{Centrality (Expected
Influence)}\label{centrality-expected-influence}

Expected Influence (\citeproc{ref-robinaugh2016identifying}{Robinaugh et
al., 2016}) quantifies the centrality of each node in the network---that
is, how strongly connected it is to other nodes. Expected influence is
computed as the sum of a node's edge weights to all other nodes (without
taking absolute values), preserving the sign of the relationships. Nodes
with higher expected influence are more central to the network and may
play a more important role in the overall system.

Formally, for node \emph{i}:

\[
EI_i = \sum_{j \neq i} r_{ij}
\]

Unlike older centrality metrics (e.g., betweenness, closeness), expected
influence is appropriate for networks estimated from partial
correlations and does not require thresholding edges or converting the
network to a binary graph. We chose expected influence over strength
(which uses absolute values) because it preserves directional
information: a node can have high expected influence by being positively
connected to many nodes, whereas strength would treat positive and
negative edges equivalently. In EF networks where edges are
predominantly positive, the two metrics converge, but expected influence
provides a more nuanced picture if any negative edges emerge.

\subsubsection{Change and Comparison
Analyses}\label{change-and-comparison-analyses}

To test for developmental change within cohorts (RQ2), we computed
difference scores between adjacent waves (e.g., Δr = r\textsubscript{T2}
− r\textsubscript{T1}) by subtracting posterior samples pairwise. This
yields a posterior distribution of the change, from which we derived
95\% credible intervals and ROPE probabilities for the difference
(P(\textbar Δr\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.10)).

For cross-cohort comparisons (RQ3), we computed cohort difference scores
(e.g., r\textsubscript{AU} − r\textsubscript{SA}) at matched waves. To
account for the bounded nature of correlations, we also report
differences on the Fisher z-scale (z = atanh(r)), which transforms
correlations to an unbounded scale where differences are more symmetric.
Results on both scales were substantively similar, indicating our
findings are not artifacts of scale constraints.

For difference-in-differences (DiD) contrasts, we tested whether cohorts
showed divergent developmental trajectories by computing
(Δr\textsubscript{T2-T1})\textsubscript{AU} −
(Δr\textsubscript{T2-T1})\textsubscript{SA}. A meaningful DiD would
indicate that one cohort changed more than the other over time.

\subsubsection{Moderation Analyses}\label{moderation-analyses}

To test whether socioeconomic factors moderate network structure (RQ4),
we adopted a stratified approach. Within each cohort, we split children
into High vs.~Low groups based on median splits of baseline (T1) income
and home learning environment (HLE), then fit separate BGGM models for
each group at each wave. We computed moderation effects as High − Low
edge differences, with ROPE probabilities indicating the strength of
evidence for moderation (P(\textbar High − Low\textbar{} \textgreater{}
0.10)). This stratified approach is more robust than including SES as a
continuous covariate in a single model, as it allows network structure
to differ nonlinearly across SES groups and does not assume constant
effects across the SES distribution.

\subsubsection{Measurement Invariance}\label{measurement-invariance}

We tested measurement invariance using multi-group confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) in the lavaan R package
(\citeproc{ref-rosseel2012lavaan}{Rosseel, 2012}). Because cognitive
flexibility exhibited pronounced floor effects in Australian children
(see Figure~\ref{fig-ef-boxplots-by-wave}) at T1 (32.5\% scoring zero),
we treated all three EF indicators as ordinal variables, segmenting them
into tertiles (Low/Medium/High) based on pooled distributions. We fit a
single-factor ordinal CFA model across four groups simultaneously
(AU\_T1, AU\_T2, SA\_T1, SA\_T2), testing invariance across both cohorts
and developmental timepoints using robust weighted least squares
estimation (WLSMV). We tested three levels of invariance:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Configural invariance}: The same factor structure (three
  indicators loading on one factor) holds across all groups
\item
  \textbf{Metric invariance}: Factor loadings are equal across groups
  (components relate to the latent EF construct equivalently)
\item
  \textbf{Scalar invariance}: Thresholds (category boundaries for
  ordinal indicators) are equal across groups
\end{enumerate}

We evaluated invariance using chi-square difference tests (Δχ²) and
changes in fit indices (ΔCFI), with ΔCFI \textless{} 0.01 supporting
invariance (\citeproc{ref-cheung2002evaluating}{Cheung \& Rensvold,
2002}). Metric invariance is a prerequisite for comparing network
structures (relationships between EF components) across groups, while
scalar invariance is required for comparing mean levels.

\subsubsection{Software}\label{software}

All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5.0). Network models were
fit using BGGM (version 2.1.5), measurement invariance tests used lavaan
(version 0.6.19), and visualizations used ggplot2 (version 4.0.0).
Analysis code is available at {[}include github url{]}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsubsection{Measurement Invariance}\label{measurement-invariance-1}

To evaluate cross-cohort comparability of EF indicators, we conducted
multi-group confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) across four cohort×wave
groups (AU\_T1, AU\_T2, SA\_T1, SA\_T2), thereby testing invariance
simultaneously across countries and developmental timepoints. Because
cognitive flexibility exhibited pronounced floor effects in Australian
children at T1 (32.5\% scoring zero), all three EF indicators were
treated as ordinal variables using robust weighted least squares
estimation (WLSMV). Indicators were segmented into tertiles based on
pooled distributions to ensure adequate category representation.

In ordinal CFA, each observed categorical indicator reflects an
underlying continuous latent response variable partitioned by
thresholds. Factor loadings capture the strength of association between
the latent EF construct and each indicator, while thresholds capture
distributional placement of categories. This allows floor effect
severity to be represented through threshold parameters without
distorting factor loadings.

We estimated a one-factor model in a sequence of increasingly
constrained models. Configural invariance was supported. Constraining
factor loadings equal across groups (metric invariance) did not
significantly reduce fit (Δχ²(6) = 2.62, \emph{p} = 0.854; ΔCFI = 0),
indicating comparable strength of association between the EF factor and
its indicators. However, constraining thresholds (scalar invariance)
significantly worsened fit (Δχ²(6) = 35.29, \emph{p} \textless{} .001;
ΔCFI = -0.154), with CFI declining from 1 to 0.846, indicating
systematic threshold differences across groups. Metric invariance
supports comparison of network structures (relationships between EF
components) across cohorts, though absolute performance levels cannot be
compared (see Table~\ref{tbl-invariance}) .

\subsubsection{Research Question 1 (Primary): EF Network Structure
Within
Cohorts}\label{research-question-1-primary-ef-network-structure-within-cohorts}

Within each cohort and wave, what is the age-adjusted EF
network---defined by partial correlations among working memory,
inhibition, and cognitive flexibility---and what do global strength and
expected influence indicate about overall connectivity and node
centrality?

\subsubsection{Edges}\label{edges}

Within-wave age-adjusted partial correlations are summarized in
Table~\ref{tbl-rq1-gt-all} and visualized in
Figure~\ref{fig-rq1-edge-forest}. In Australia, edges involving working
memory showed the clearest evidence of coupling across waves. The
inhibition--working memory edge was consistently positive (T1: 0.27
{[}0.15, 0.39{]}; T2: 0.32 {[}0.20, 0.44{]}; T3: 0.30 {[}0.12, 0.47{]})
and reliably exceeded the meaningfulness threshold (T1:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=1.00; T2:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=1.00; T3:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.98). The cognitive
flexibility--working memory edge was also positive across waves (T1:
0.25 {[}0.13, 0.37{]}; T2: 0.20 {[}0.06, 0.32{]}; T3: 0.13 {[}-0.06,
0.32{]}) and exceeded the meaningfulness threshold (meaningfulness: T1:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.99; T2:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.92; T3:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.63). In contrast, the cognitive
flexibility--inhibition edge was weaker and more wave-dependent (T1:
0.06 {[}-0.07, 0.19{]}; T2: 0.14 {[}0.01, 0.27{]}; T3: 0.19 {[}-0.00,
0.36{]}), with less consistent evidence that it exceeded the
meaningfulness threshold (T1: P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.28;
T2: P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.75; T3:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.83).

In South Africa, the inhibition--working memory edge remained positive
across waves (T1: 0.17 {[}0.03, 0.30{]}; T2: 0.19 {[}0.04, 0.33{]}) and
met the meaningfulness criterion more consistently than the other edges
(T1: P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.83; T2:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.89). The cognitive
flexibility--inhibition edge was stronger at T1 (0.21 {[}0.08, 0.34{]})
but attenuated at T2 (0.10 {[}-0.04, 0.24{]}) and did not reliably
exceed the meaningfulness threshold at T2 (T1:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.95; T2:
P(\textbar r\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.51). In contrast to the
Australian results, he cognitive flexibility--working memory edge was
comparatively weaker and uncertain across waves (T1: 0.12 {[}-0.02,
0.26{]}; T2: 0.12 {[}-0.03, 0.26{]}).

Expected influence estimates (signed sum of incident partial

visualized over time by node in Figure~\ref{fig-rq1-ei-trend-by-node-n}.
In Australia, expected influence was consistently positive across nodes
and waves, with working memory showing the highest expected influence
across waves (T1: 0.52 {[}0.36, 0.68{]}; T2: 0.52 {[}0.36, 0.67{]}; T3:
0.44 {[}0.19, 0.65{]}). Inhibition showed comparatively high expected
influence from T2 onward (T1: 0.33 {[}0.18, 0.49{]}; T2: 0.47 {[}0.30,
0.62{]}; T3: 0.49 {[}0.26, 0.72{]}), whereas cognitive flexibility was
lower and more stable across waves (T1: 0.31 {[}0.16, 0.46{]}; T2: 0.34
{[}0.19, 0.49{]}; T3: 0.32 {[}0.10, 0.54{]}). These patterns are evident
in Figure~\ref{fig-rq1-ei-trend-by-node-n}, which shows sustained
positive centrality for all three nodes in the Australian cohort, with
working memory and inhibition contributing most strongly to within-wave
coupling across time.

In South Africa, expected influence was positive but generally lower,
with attenuation from T1 to T2 for inhibition and cognitive flexibility
(inhibition: T1: 0.38 {[}0.21, 0.54{]}; T2: 0.29 {[}0.10, 0.48{]};
cognitive flexibility: T1: 0.34 {[}0.17, 0.50{]}; T2: 0.22 {[}0.04,
0.40{]}). Working memory showed comparatively stable expected influence
across waves (T1: 0.29 {[}0.12, 0.46{]}; T2: 0.31 {[}0.11, 0.49{]}).
Figure~\ref{fig-rq1-ei-trend-by-node-n} shows a downward shift from T1
to T2 for inhibition and cognitive flexibility in South Africa, while
working memory remains comparatively steady. \clearpage

\subsubsection{Research Question 2 (Primary): Developmental Change
Within
Cohorts}\label{research-question-2-primary-developmental-change-within-cohorts}

Within each cohort, do the EF conditional associations (partial
correlations) change across adjacent waves (AU: T1→T2→T3; SA: T1→T2),
and if so, which specific edges strengthen or weaken over time?

Given metric invariance, we compared network structures across adjacent
waves within each cohort. For each wave transition, we computed
posterior distributions of change in edge weights (Δr = later wave −
earlier wave), global strength (Δ), and expected influence (Δ). We
evaluated whether changes exceeded a region of practical equivalence
(ROPE; \textbar Δr\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.10) to distinguish
meaningful developmental change from negligible fluctuation.

We found little evidence for meaningful change in EF network summaries
across adjacent waves within either cohort (see
Table~\ref{tbl-rq2-gt-all}). Posterior 95\% CrIs for all Δs included 0,
and probabilities that edge changes exceeded the ROPE
(\textbar Δr\textbar{} \textgreater{} 0.10) were modest (≈0.3--0.6),
indicating substantial uncertainty and no clear support for meaningful
change.

\subsubsection{Research Question 3 (Secondary): Cross-Cohort
Comparisons}\label{research-question-3-secondary-cross-cohort-comparisons}

At matched waves (T1 and T2), do AU and SA differ in EF conditional
associations, and do the cohorts show divergent developmental
trajectories from T1 to T2 (difference-in-differences)?

A substantial floor effect was observed in Australian T1 cognitive
flexibility (32.5\% scoring zero), raising potential concerns for
cross-cohort network comparisons. Floor effects can induce artificial
correlations through range restriction and may bias partial correlation
estimates. To address this, we (1) Report cross-cohort comparisons using
the full sample (primary analysis), and (2) Conduct sensitivity analyses
excluding children who scored zero on cognitive flexibility at each
wave. If results converge across analyses, this would suggest floor
effects do not meaningfully distort cross-cohort comparisons. Divergence
would indicate that apparent cohort differences partly reflect
measurement artefacts.

\textbf{Main Analysis (Full Sample).}: At T1, posterior medians
suggested modest AU--SA differences in several edges; however, all 95\%
credible intervals overlapped zero. At T2, cohort differences were
smaller and predominantly positive, but again uncertain. In the
difference-in-differences analysis, most edges were centered near zero.
The largest deviation was observed for CogFlex--Inhibition (median =
0.2; 95\% CrI {[}-0.08, 0.47{]}; P(\textbar Δr\textbar\textgreater0.10)
= 0.78), though its credible interval still included zero, indicating
substantial uncertainty. Results were substantively unchanged when
differences were summarized on the Fisher z (atanh) scale
(Table~\ref{tbl-rq3-gt-edges-dual}).

\textbf{Sensitivity Analysis (Excluding Cognitive Flexibility Floor
Performers).}: Given the pronounced floor effect in Australian T1
cognitive flexibility (75/232 excluded {[}32.3\%{]}; AU T2: 42/217
{[}19.4\%{]}; SA T1: 0/217 {[}0\%{]}; SA T2: 7/189 {[}3.7\%{]}), we
refitted networks after wave-specific exclusion of children scoring zero
on cognitive flexibility. Estimates were highly similar in direction and
magnitude to the main analysis (see
Table~\ref{tbl-rq3-sensitivity-comparison}), with credible intervals
widening due to reduced sample size. Patterns at T2 and in the
difference-in-differences analysis were nearly identical.Together, these
results indicate that cross-cohort differences in EF network structure
are small and uncertain.

\subsubsection{RQ4 (Exploratory): Socioeconomic Moderation of Network
Structure}\label{rq4-exploratory-socioeconomic-moderation-of-network-structure}

Within each cohort, does EF network structure differ between children
from high versus low baseline (T1) household income and home learning
environments? Specifically, are edges systematically stronger or weaker
in high-SES groups across waves?

Exploratory moderation analyses revealed little consistent evidence that
baseline income or HLE systematically altered EF network structure
within cohorts. However, in Australia at T2, the cognitive
flexibility--working memory edge was substantially weaker among children
from high-income families (High−Low: −0.46 {[}−0.80, −0.11{]},
P(\textbar Δ\textbar\textgreater0.1)=0.98), suggesting that
socioeconomic advantage may be associated with more differentiated EF
development. Conversely, HLE showed tentative positive moderation
patterns (stronger coupling in enriched home environments), though
credible intervals crossed zero.

\textbf{Note.} Summaries are restricted to children with any EF data at each wave (partial EF allowed). In Australia, caregiver education, household income, and the HLE Index are measured once per child and carried across waves; \emph{n} and summary statistics may still differ across T1--T3 because the EF-available sample varies by wave (attrition/partial EF). In South Africa, caregiver education, income, and HLE measures are recorded by wave and summarised only where collected (later-wave cells are NA if not assessed).\\
